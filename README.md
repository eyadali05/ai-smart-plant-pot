# Smart Plant Pot – AI-Powered Plant Health & Automation System  
*Edge Vision AI · Embedded Sensors · Raspberry Pi + Arduino · Telegram Bot Control*

This project is an end-to-end **autonomous plant-care system** combining **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and multiple environmental sensors to monitor plant health, classify plant species, and automate watering.  
The entire system runs **on-edge**, enabling fast real-time inference and offline operation.

## Features

### 1. Vision AI Plant Classification
- Captures plant images via Raspberry Pi Camera  
- Classifies using TensorFlow Lite (trained on 14k samples, 47 classes, ~86% accuracy) on the dataset of [house-plant-species](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kakasher/house-plant-species/tree/main)
- Sends the detected plant name via Telegram  
- Sub-second inference on Raspberry Pi  

### 2. Real-Time Environmental Monitoring
Arduino continuously collects:
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Soil Moisture  
- Light Intensity  

### 3. Automated & Manual Watering
- Automatic watering based on plant requirements  
- Manual watering available via `/water`  

### 4. Telegram Bot Remote Interface
Supported commands:
- **`/scan`** — Capture & classify plant  
- **`/status`** — Show all sensor readings  
- **`/water`** — Activate pump  

### 5. Smart Recommendation Logic
After classification, the Pi checks an online database for:
- Optimal temperature  
- Ideal humidity range  
- Recommended watering schedule  

Then compares these values with real sensor readings.
